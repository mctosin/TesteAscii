Code monkey go to job
Code monkey have boring meeting
With boring manager rob
Rob say code monkey very dilligent
But his output stink
His code not functional or elegant

Code monkey very simple man
With big warm fuzzy secret heart

To get out this place
Code monkey just keep on working

Take bath, take nap

Code monkey just waiting for now
Code monkey say someday, somehow

Code monkey like fritos
Code monkey like tab and mountain dew
Code monkey very simple man
With big warm fuzzy secret heart
